# Ghost hex is here!

This repo is here to show you how I coded Ghost Hex, it's fairly simple and leaves a lot of room for easy expansion.

The AI is a little off, so if you're up to it, you can give a spin to trying to fix it!

## SDL

This proyect uses the [SDL library](https://github.com/libsdl-org) to manage many functions related to images.

## Build

Although this should easily build in your PC through Visual Studio, you can get a prebuilt version in this game's [Itch.io Page](https://smashed-tomatoes.itch.io/ghost-hex).

This game's only dependancy is the SLD library.
